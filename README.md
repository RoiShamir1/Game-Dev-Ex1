Game Objective
Your mission is simple: reach the coin and collect it!
The moment you touch the coin, the game ends with a victory.

Game Rules
Touching a hazard will send your player back to the starting point.
Boxes will keep falling from above - they vanish when hitting the ground, but new ones will always drop again.
Collecting the coin immediately ends the game with a win.

Controls
Left / Right Arrow Keys (or A / D) - Move the player left and right.
